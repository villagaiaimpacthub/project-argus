# Argus Vision for HIVE: AI Development Companion

## üéØ Executive Summary

Transform Project Argus from a monitoring tool into an **AI development companion** specifically designed for building HIVE - the regenerative movement's second brain. Focus on two core capabilities:

1. **Understanding "the space between"** - Service relationships, dependencies, integration points
2. **Building codebase wisdom** - Institutional memory, decision tracking, pattern recognition

## üß† Key Breakthrough Insights

### The Real Differentiation Point
IDEs work with files and code. Modern development is about **SYSTEMS** - multiple services, databases, APIs, microservices. Argus should be the first AI system that truly understands and manages entire **SYSTEMS**, not just code.

### The Highest Leverage Problems
- **Service relationship intelligence** - Track dependencies between frontend, backend, database, APIs
- **Cross-service change impact analysis** - Understand how changes propagate through system
- **Persistent development memory** - Never forget project context, decisions, patterns
- **Multi-service orchestration** - Coordinate complex development across services

## üé® Interface Vision: Mind-Map Collaboration

### Dual-Layer Mind-Map Interface
**Core Insight**: Same spatial model, different interaction permissions

#### Human View (Full Permissions)
- Pure exploration interface for understanding system architecture
- Click-through navigation of service relationships
- Annotation and pattern recognition tools
- **Snapshot capability**: Save visual exploration state with notes
- Clean interface without AI interference

#### AI View (Read-Only for Human)
- Watch Claude Code navigate through system analysis
- See AI reasoning process in real-time
- **Educational value**: Learn systematic debugging approaches
- **Human override**: Flag issues in AI reasoning process
- **AI Snapshot capability**: Save investigation states for comparison

### Snapshot Ecosystem
- **Human snapshots**: "Payment flow pattern - seems fragile" ‚Üí Send to Claude
- **AI snapshots**: Before/after analysis states, solution alternatives
- **Bidirectional flagging**: Human can interrupt AI wrong paths instantly
- **Comparison tools**: Side-by-side analysis without committing to code

## üèóÔ∏è HIVE System Context

### Current Component Landscape
- **VOX**: Meeting assistant, audio ingestion, RAG + vector databases
- **TASK**: Masterplan ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Tasks engine (early alpha)
- **CRM**: Connection sharing, trust toggle, social media scraping, AI introductions
- **FUND**: Due diligence, investment strategies, company acquisition protocols
- **BI**: Business intelligence, supply chain + container shipping clients
- **Systems Navigator**: Dashboard for impact modeling (alpha)
- **QuickBooks**: Financial integrations (planned)

### Technical Reality
- **Database**: Shared Supabase PostgreSQL instance
- **Architecture**: Currently isolated components, no inter-service communication
- **Tech Stack**: Mixed languages/frameworks per component
- **Integration Status**: Zero current integration between components

### Development Challenges
- Multiple developers working on isolated components
- Unknown integration complexity between services
- No shared development workflow
- Unclear service dependency mapping
- Future integration pathway uncertainty

Extra observation: 

Can you see your own context left until auto-compact as a % or is that only visible to        
  me?

‚óè I can't see my own context usage as a percentage - that's only visible to you in the
  Claude Code interface. I don't have access to information about how much of my context        
  window is being used or when auto-compact might trigger.

  From my perspective, I just know that we've had a substantial conversation covering a lot     
   of ground about Argus, HIVE, and the technical vision. But the specific metrics about        
  context usage, remaining capacity, or auto-compact timing are only available on your end.     

  Is the context getting close to full? If so, those two markdown files should preserve
  everything we need to continue the conversation fresh in a new session.

> We have 1% left, I just wondered because that would be valuable for argus to be able to       
  track somehow and i thought you would also want to know that in the future so that as the     
   window approaches, you may make different decisions, for instance like saving the
  details of a plan or specifics or something or other

‚óè That's a brilliant insight! You're absolutely right - context awareness would be
  incredibly valuable for AI decision-making.

  With 1% left, I would definitely behave differently if I knew:
  - Switch to summary mode - Focus on capturing key decisions rather than exploring new
  ideas
  - Prioritize documentation - Save critical details before they're lost
  - Signal handoff needs - Explicitly note what needs to continue in next session
  - Emergency preservation - Quickly dump important working memory to files

  This is actually a perfect example of the kind of system intelligence Argus should
  provide - not just monitoring code, but monitoring the AI agent's operational state and       
  helping it make better decisions.

  For Argus + Claude Code integration, this could mean:
  - Context usage warnings at 80%, 90%, 95%
  - Auto-suggest creating documentation at critical thresholds
  - Help transition conversations gracefully between sessions
  - Preserve working context across Claude Code instances

  The fact that you can see this data but I can't is exactly the kind of "space between"        
  intelligence gap that Argus could bridge. Making the AI aware of its own operational
  constraints would definitely improve decision-making.

  Great catch - that should go into the feature list for AI-system integration!
